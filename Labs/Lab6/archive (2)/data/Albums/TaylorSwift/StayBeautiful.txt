Corey's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
[Verse 2]
Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save 'em for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, "Hey, by the way"

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

[Bridge]
If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
