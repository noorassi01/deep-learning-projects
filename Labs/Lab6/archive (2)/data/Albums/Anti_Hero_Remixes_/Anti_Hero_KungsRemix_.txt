I'm the problem, I-I-I'm the problem, it's—
I'm the problem, I'm the problem, it's—

[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as timе)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
Onе day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
[Chorus]
It's me (Me), hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me (Me), hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Breakdown]
(I'll stare, I'll stare, I'll stare dire—, I'll stare)
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
(I'll stare, I'll stare, I'll stare dire—, I'll stare)
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
(I'll stare, I'll stare) It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees
(I'm the problem, I-I-I'm the problem, it's—)
I'll stare directly in the sun, but never in the mirror
(I'm the problem, I'm the problem, it's—)
(I'm the problem, I-I-I'm the problem, it's—)
(I'm the problem, I'm the problem, it's—)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
[Outro]
I'll stare dire—, I'll stare, I'll stare dire—, I'll stare, I'll stare dire—
Always rooting for the anti-heroEmbed
