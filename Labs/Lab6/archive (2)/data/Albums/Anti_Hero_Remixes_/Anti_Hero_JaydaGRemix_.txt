It's me, hi
It's me, hi

[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tirеd of my scheming
[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problеm, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Post-Chorus]
It's me, hi
It's me, hi

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

It's me, hi
It's me, hi

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Post-Chorus]
It's me, hi
It's me, hi

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
[Post-Chorus]
It's me, hi
It's me, hi

[Outro]
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-heroEmbed
