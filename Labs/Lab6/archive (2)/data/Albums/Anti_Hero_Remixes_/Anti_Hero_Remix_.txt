(I'm the problem, it's me)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
(Always rooting for the anti-hero)

[Verse 2: Jack Antonoff]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is an art bro lately
And I just judge them on the hill
Too hurt to hang out, talking shit about your famous baby
Pierced through the heart of '90s guilt
Maybe I'm the problem, it's me

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(Taylor, you'll be fine)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me (Me), hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Post-Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
Always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from Hell"

[Breakdown: Both, Jack Antonoff, Taylor Swift]
I'm the problem, it's me
(Taylor)
(I'm the problem, it's me)

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff]
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
[Outro: Jack Antonoff, Taylor Swift, Both]
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero2Embed
