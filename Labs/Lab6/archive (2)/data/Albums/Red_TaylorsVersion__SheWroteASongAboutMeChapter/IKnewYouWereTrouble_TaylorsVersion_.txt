Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were troublе when you walked in
So shame on mе now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see-e-e-e-e

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey
You might also like[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh (Yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Bridge]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her
Or anyone, or anything, yeah

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble23Embed
