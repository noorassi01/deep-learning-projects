5 ContributorsLavender Haze (Tensnake Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Meet me at midnight

[Verse 1]
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia

[Pre-Chorus]
I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah)
You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)
All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah)
[Chorus]
I feel
The lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
I feel
The lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
Meet me at midnight

[Verse 2]
All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see)
Is a one-night or a wife

[Pre-Chorus]
I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh, yeah)
They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)
But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)
You might also like[Chorus]
I feel
The lavender haze creepin' up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
I feel
The lavender haze creepin' up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Stay
Stay
Stay
Stay

[Outro]
I just wanna stay in that lavender hazeEmbed
