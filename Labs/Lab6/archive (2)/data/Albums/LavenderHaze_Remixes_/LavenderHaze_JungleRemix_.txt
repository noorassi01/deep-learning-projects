3 ContributorsLavender Haze (Jungle Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia

[Pre-Chorus]
I been under scrutiny (Golly)
You handle it beautifully (Beau)
All this shit is new to me (Golly), new to me, new to me, new to me, new to me
I been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All this shit is new to me (Golly), new to me, new to me, new to me, new to me
[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me (Golly)
Surreal (Golly)
(New to me, nеw to me, new to me, nеw to me)
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze (Golly)

[Post-Chorus]
All this shit is new to me (Golly)
All this shit is, new
All this shit is new to me (Golly)
New to me, new to me, new to me, new to me
New to me, new to me, new to me, new to me (Golly)
New to me, new to me, new to me, new to me
New to me, new to me, new to me (Golly)

[Pre-Chorus]
I find it dizzying (Golly)
They're bringing up my history
But you aren't even listening
New to me, new to me, new to me, new to me
New to me

[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creepin' up on me
Surreal (All this shit is new to me)
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
(All this shit is new to me)
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
