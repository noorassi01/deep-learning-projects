1 ContributorFly Me To The Moon Lyrics(chorus)

Man on the moon, if my dream works
Smile, picture the cheese, extreme perks
Shooting stars, please me first...
Spaced out face to lace the merchandise t-shirts
Bars are mars, milky way and galaxies
Light speed beaming for your planets needs

(sample)

Down to earth, leave the ego trip
Play the action hero, thats zero hits
Keep my tricks, beneath my sleeve
See a voice can open doors I need alisha's keys
Or Stevie's songs, wondrous CD roms
Till I can Channel three at once
Remote chance you'll see me on
Commercial breaks, to get my first commercial break
Shame cos your best verse ain't better than the worst I make

But then again with the pen I question
How to impress my expression?
If I don't pay you don't pay me attention
Degraded, late for detention
Berated, I wait on the bench and
Eventually I'm gonna make my start
Young blood with a body of work
But flowing in vein that'll break my heart
Sacred art or waste of time, I guess that you decide?
Killing myself to be myself, artistic suicide
Don't like what I see when I'm wide awake
So I escape that's no surprise, close my eyes
Wrote my rhymes, thinking of a life I hope is mine
You might also like(chorus)

Man on the moon, if my dream works
Smile, picture the cheese, extreme perks
Shooting stars, please me first...
Spaced out face to lace the merchandise t-shirts
Bars are mars, milky way and galaxies
Light speed beaming for your planets needs

(sample)

Fame won't suit me, Interrupt the taylor swift
That relationship will tie you up, I sail adrift
The more ipod ports, I'm downloaded on..
The more you owe me one, the only hope - Obi Wan
I lay a hot verse, never lukewarm
Soloist or group, shown up in your true form
Snatch the mask off the empire, barefaced liars in the blast of my pen fire

(It's too real)

But then again I might be fictive
Voice in the mind, lines are addictive
Like coke, call it cola or cain
Polar flow, cold blow to the brain
Freeze, at ease I breeze on by
Like a private jet but not quite that fly
More like a paper plane
No jet fuel for the naked flame
So if I crash and burn, there'll be no ash in urn
I return, take the world by storm, striking without flashy terms
Lightning, bolt the doors
My reign, loud on the air
The last king has thrown the crown, and its now on the heir
Man on the moon, if my dream works
Smile, picture the cheese, extreme perks
Shooting stars, please me first...
Spaced out face to lace the merchandise t-shirts
Bars are mars, milky way and galaxies
Light speed beaming for your planets needsEmbed
