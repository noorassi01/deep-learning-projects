9 ContributorsMessage In A Bottle (Taylor’s Version) (Fat Max G Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin' (Waitin')
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied

[Pre-Chorus]
But now (now)
You're so far away and I'm down (Down)
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified-ied-ied-ied
[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could bе the reason you can't sleep at night
A messagе in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

[Verse 2]
These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless, look how you made me (Made me)
But time moves faster, replaying your laughter, disaster

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause now (now)
You're so far away and I'm down (down)
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified-ied-ied-ied, 'cause

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)
You could be the one that I keep, and I (I)
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (At night)
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

I know-know-know that you like-like me-me
Bright-bright tongue-tied (Tongue-tied)
I know-know-know that you like-like me-me
Bright-bright tongue-tied (Tongue-tied)
You could be the one that I love, mm-mm
And now I'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

[Chorus]
(Yeah, yeah)
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (You can't sleep at night)
A message in a bottle is all I can do (Yeah, yeah)
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
You could be the one that I love
You could be the one that I love, I love
And now I'm standin' here, hopin' this gets to you4Embed
