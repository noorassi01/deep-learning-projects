CHORUS.<br>
Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;<br>
Whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows<br>
Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.<br>
The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,<br>
And the continuance of their parents’ rage,<br>
Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,<br>
Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;<br>
The which, if you with patient ears attend,<br>
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

<h3> <b>SCENE I. A public place.</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Sampson</span> and
<span class="charname">Gregory</span> armed with swords and bucklers.</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.
</p>
<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br>
No, for then we should be colliers.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
I mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.
</p>
<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br>
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
I strike quickly, being moved.
</p>
<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br>
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br>
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn’st away.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.<br>
I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.
</p>
<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br>
That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men
from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.
</p>
<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br>
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought
with the men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.
</p>
<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br>
The heads of the maids?
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense
thou wilt.
</p>
<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br>
They must take it in sense that feel it.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand:
and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
</p>
<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br>
’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor
John. Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Abram</span> and
<span class="charname">Balthasar</span>.</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
</p>
<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br>
How? Turn thy back and run?
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
Fear me not.
</p>
<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br>
No, marry; I fear thee!
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
</p>
<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br>
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they
list.</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is
disgrace to them if they bear it.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ABRAM.<br>
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
I do bite my thumb, sir.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ABRAM.<br>
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
Is the law of our side if I say ay?
</p>
<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br>
No.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
thumb, sir.</p>
<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br>
Do you quarrel, sir?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ABRAM.<br>
Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as
you.</p>
<p class="drama">
ABRAM.<br>
No better.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br>
Well, sir.
</p>

GREGORY.<br>
Say better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.

SAMPSON.<br>
Yes, better, sir.

ABRAM.<br>
You lie.

PRINCE.<br>
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,<br>
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—<br>
Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,<br>
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage<br>
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,<br>
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands<br>
Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground<br>
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.<br>
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,<br>
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,<br>
Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,<br>
And made Verona’s ancient citizens<br>
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,<br>
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,<br>
Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.<br>
If ever you disturb our streets again,<br>
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.<br>
For this time all the rest depart away:<br>
You, Capulet, shall go along with me,<br>
And Montague, come you this afternoon,<br>
To know our farther pleasure in this case,<br>
To old Free-town, our common judgement-place.<br>
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?<br>
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
</p>
<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br>
Here were the servants of your adversary<br>
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.<br>
I drew to part them, in the instant came<br>
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,<br>
Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,<br>
He swung about his head, and cut the winds,<br>
Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.<br>
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows<br>
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,<br>
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LADY MONTAGUE.<br>
O where is Romeo, saw you him today?<br>
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
</p>
<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br>
Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun<br>
Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,<br>
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,<br>
Where underneath the grove of sycamore<br>
That westward rooteth from this city side,<br>
So early walking did I see your son.<br>
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,<br>
And stole into the covert of the wood.<br>
I, measuring his affections by my own,<br>
Which then most sought where most might not be found,<br>
Being one too many by my weary self,<br>
Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,<br>
And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
MONTAGUE.<br>
Many a morning hath he there been seen,<br>
With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,<br>
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;<br>
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun<br>
Should in the farthest east begin to draw<br>
The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,<br>
Away from light steals home my heavy son,<br>
And private in his chamber pens himself,<br>
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out<br>
And makes himself an artificial night.<br>
Black and portentous must this humour prove,<br>
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
</p>
<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br>
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
</p>
<p class="drama">
MONTAGUE.<br>
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
</p>
<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br>
Have you importun’d him by any means?

Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:<br>
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,<br>

Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;<br>
O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;<br>
O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;<br>
O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,<br>
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,<br>
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:<br>
Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,<br>
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;<br>
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,<br>
Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,<br>
Then dreams he of another benefice:<br>
Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,<br>
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,<br>
Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,<br>
Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon<br>
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;<br>
And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,<br>
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab<br>
That plats the manes of horses in the night;<br>
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,<br>
Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:<br>
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,<br>
That presses them, and learns them first to bear,<br>
Making them women of good carriage:<br>

cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of
quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle
as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the
street, because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst
thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with
another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt tutor me

But, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.<br>

PARIS.<br>
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,<br>

That she do give her sorrow so much sway;<br>

Do not deny to him that you love me.

PARIS.<br>
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,<br>

O Juliet, I already know thy grief;<br>
It strains me past the compass of my wits.<br>
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,<br>

</p>
<p class="drama">

Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,<br>
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.<br>
If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,<br>

And with this knife I’ll help it presently.<br>
God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;<br>
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,<br>
Shall be the label to another deed,<br>
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt<br>
Turn to another, this shall slay them both.<br>
Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,<br>
Give me some present counsel, or behold<br>
’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife<br>
Shall play the empire, arbitrating that<br>
Which the commission of thy years and art<br>
Could to no issue of true honour bring.<br>
Be not so long to speak. I long to die,<br>
If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.
</p>
<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br>
Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,<br>
Which craves as desperate an execution<br>
As that is desperate which we would prevent.<br>
If, rather than to marry County Paris<br>
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,<br>
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake<br>
A thing like death to chide away this shame,<br>
That cop’st with death himself to scape from it.<br>
And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,<br>
From off the battlements of yonder tower,<br>
Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk<br>
Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;<br>
Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,<br>
O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,<br>
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.<br>
Or bid me go into a new-made grave,<br>
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;<br>
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,<br>
And I will do it without fear or doubt,<br>
To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.
</p>
<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br>
Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent<br>
To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;<br>
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,<br>
Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.<br>
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,<br>
And this distilled liquor drink thou off,<br>
When presently through all thy veins shall run<br>
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse<br>
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.<br>
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,<br>
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade<br>
To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,<br>
Like death when he shuts up the day of life.<br>
Each part depriv’d of supple government,<br>
Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.<br>
And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death<br>
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,<br>
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.<br>
Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes<br>
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.<br>
Then as the manner of our country is,<br>
In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,<br>
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault<br>
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.<br>
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,<br>
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,<br>
And hither shall he come, and he and I<br>
Will watch thy waking, and that very night<br>
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.<br>
And this shall free thee from this present shame,<br>
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear<br>
Abate thy valour in the acting it.

Give me, give me! O tell not me of fear!

Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,<br>
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,<br>
One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.<br>
I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.<br>
A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,<br>
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes<br>
This vault a feasting presence full of light.<br>

<p class="drama">
How oft when men are at the point of death<br>
Have they been merry! Which their keepers call<br>
A lightning before death. O, how may I<br>
Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife,<br>
Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,<br>
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.<br>
Thou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet<br>
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,<br>
And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.<br>
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?<br>
O, what more favour can I do to thee<br>
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain<br>
To sunder his that was thine enemy?<br>
Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,<br>
Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe<br>
That unsubstantial death is amorous;<br>
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps<br>
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?<br>
For fear of that I still will stay with thee,<br>
And never from this palace of dim night<br>
Depart again. Here, here will I remain<br>
With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here<br>
Will I set up my everlasting rest;<br>
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars<br>
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.<br>
Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you<br>
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss<br>
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.<br>
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.<br>
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on<br>
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.<br>
Here’s to my love! [<i>Drinks.</i>] O true apothecary!<br>
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br>
I will be brief, for my short date of breath<br>
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.<br>
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,<br>
And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.<br>
I married them; and their stol’n marriage day<br>
Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death<br>
Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;<br>
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.<br>
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,<br>
Betroth’d, and would have married her perforce<br>
To County Paris. Then comes she to me,<br>
And with wild looks, bid me devise some means<br>
To rid her from this second marriage,<br>
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.<br>
Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,<br>
A sleeping potion, which so took effect<br>
As I intended, for it wrought on her<br>
The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo<br>
That he should hither come as this dire night<br>
To help to take her from her borrow’d grave,<br>
Being the time the potion’s force should cease.<br>
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,<br>
Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight<br>
Return’d my letter back. Then all alone<br>
At the prefixed hour of her waking<br>
Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,<br>
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell<br>
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.<br>
But when I came, some minute ere the time<br>
Of her awaking, here untimely lay<br>
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.<br>
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth<br>
And bear this work of heaven with patience.<br>
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;<br>
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,<br>
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.<br>
All this I know; and to the marriage<br>
Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this<br>
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life<br>
Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time,<br>
Unto the rigour of severest law.

We still have known thee for a holy man.<br>
Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?
</p>
<p class="drama">
BALTHASAR.<br>
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,<br>
And then in post he came from Mantua<br>
To this same place, to this same monument.<br>
This letter he early bid me give his father,<br>
And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,<br>
If I departed not, and left him there.
</p>
<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br>
Give me the letter, I will look on it.<br>
Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?<br>
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
</p>
<p class="drama">
PAGE.<br>
He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,<br>
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.<br>
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,<br>
And by and by my master drew on him,<br>
And then I ran away to call the watch.
</p>
<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br>
This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,<br>
Their course of love, the tidings of her death.<br>
And here he writes that he did buy a poison<br>
Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal<br>
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.<br>
Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,<br>
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,<br>
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!<br>
And I, for winking at your discords too,<br>
Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br>
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.<br>
This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more<br>
Can I demand.
</p>
<p class="drama">
MONTAGUE.<br>
But I can give thee more,<br>
For I will raise her statue in pure gold,<br>
That whiles Verona by that name is known,<br>
There shall no figure at such rate be set<br>
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br>
As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,<br>
Poor sacrifices of our enmity.
</p>
<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br>
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;<br>
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.<br>
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.<br>
Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,<br>
For never was a story of more woe<br>
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
